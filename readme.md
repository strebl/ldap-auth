Active Directory LDAP Authentication
=========

Laravel 4 Active Directory LDAP Authentication driver. 

Installation
============

To install this in your application add the following to your `composer.json` file

```json
require {
	"ccovey/ldap-auth": "dev-develop",
}
```

Then run 

`composer install` or `composer update` as appropriate

Once you have finished downloading the package from Packagist.org you need to tell your Application to use the LDAP service provider.

Open `config/app.php` and find

`Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider`

and replace it with

`Ccovey\LdapAuth\LdapAuthServiceProvider`

This tells Laravel 4 to use the service provider from the vendor folder.

Usage
======

To define your domain and other AD specific information you must set it in /vendor/adLDAP/adLDAP/lib/adLDAP/adLDAP.php

Use of `Auth` is the same as with the default service provider.

By Default this will have the `username (samaccountname)`, and `displayname`

To edit what is returned you can specify in `config/auth.php` under the `fields` key.

For more information on what fields from AD are available to you visit http://goo.gl/6jL4V

You may also get a complete user list for a specific OU by defining the `table` key.

Model Usage
===========

You can still use a model with this implementation as well if you want. ldap-auth will take your fields from ldap and attach them to the model allowing you to access things such as roles / permissions from the model if the account is valid in Active Directory.
